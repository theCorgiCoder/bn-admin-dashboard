# Admin Dashboard: A practice in CSS Grid

## Developers

[Elaine Bergstr√∂m](https://github.com/theCorgiCoder) & [Ahmed Hatem](https://github.com/aHatem97)

## The Challenge

To create a Dashboard webpage using HTML, CSS, and more specifically CSS Grid for all the layout and placement of components.
Since neither of us were well practiced in CSS Grid it proved quite the challenge.
